README

This python script solves the 8 queens problem,
however, you can input any number of queens you want.
inputing more than 20 might not finish very fast though

Running the program is simple, the first argument to the 
program is the number of queens you want to find a table for.
A second argument indicates "verbose" output, 
and can be anything you want.

ex:  python3 queens.py 8
ex2: python3 queens.py 8 spaghetti

Enjoy the program!
